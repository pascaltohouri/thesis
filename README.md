The pdf_graph_update file contains my thesis project code.
The main execution file is in "time_based_execution.py"
An alternative, simpler execution file is in "step_wise_execution.py".
The "test_update.py" file contains a debugging script for visualising the graph nodes and PDF.
"test_full_execution.py" contains a second debugging script for the two main execution files.
Thank you for taking the time to consider my project.
